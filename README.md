# Reinforcement Learning Environments List

Reinforcement Learning environments Index. Suggestions for additions via [pull request](http://makeapullrequest.com) welcome!

Find your perfect learning environment at: [rlenv.directory](http://rlenv.directory)

## Introduction

In the age of supervised learning datasets where a major force in the machine learning strategy. Processing capacity, algorithms and data defined the evolution of the field.

Similarly, reinforcement learning is limited by processing capacity and algorithmic innovation, but, in contrast to supervised learning is strongly dependent on learning environments. Learning environments can be seen as simulations of real life processes, simple or complex. 

Therefore, a key piece for the progression in the field of reinforcement learning are new learning environments. The mission of this platform is to encourage the creation of new and more complex learning environments through facilitating the discovery of new environments by indexing them.

## Contributing

All learning environments are stored in a easy to edit json file, steps for adding a new environment are:

1. Forking the repository
2. Adding the environment to "/data/envs.json"
3. Opening a pull request

## Bug Reports

All issue reports are welcome, more detailed guidelines will be added soon.
