## Introduction

In the age of supervised learning datasets were a major force in the machine learning strategy. Processing capacity, algorithms and data defined the evolution of the field.

Similarly, processing capacity, algorithmic innovation and "datasets" limit progress in the reinforcement learning field. Datasets in this field come in the form of so called learning environments. Learning environments can be seen as simulations of real life processes, simple or complex. 

Therefore, a key piece for progress in the field of reinforcement learning are new learning environments. The mission of this platform is to encourage the creation of new and more complex learning environments through facilitating the discovery of new environments by indexing them.

## Contributing

All learning environments are stored in a easy to edit json file, steps for adding a new environment are:

1. Forking the repository
2. Adding the environment to "/data/envs.json"
3. Opening a pull request

## Bug Reports

All issue reports are welcome, more detailed guidelines will be added soon.
